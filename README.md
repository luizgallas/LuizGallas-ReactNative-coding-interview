# React Native Coding Exercise

Before joining the live coding challenge, you should have set up the local environments for the application. This document will guide you through the process.

# Setup

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

> :warning: We recommend you read the code so that you are not caught off guard.

# What does the coding exercise looks like?

The coding exercise session will be more like a pair programming exercise, we will request you to implement a feature, solve bugs or give code advice. You will be able to use google and any documentation that can help you. Instructions will be provided in the live coding session.

## Basic requirements

- Your preferred IDE / Code Editor

## Libraries used:

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/)
